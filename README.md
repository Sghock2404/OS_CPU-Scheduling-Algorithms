# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

1 Overview 
In this project, you are going to build a “discrete-time event simulator” (see site below) for a 
number of CPU scheduling algorithms on a single CPU system. The goal of this project is to 
compare and assess the impact of different scheduling algorithms on different performance 
metrics, and across multiple workloads.

1.1 CPU Scheduling Algorithms 
We are going to implement the following CPU scheduling algorithms that we learned in class: 
1. First-Come First-Served (FCFS) [non-preemptive]
2. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) [preemptive by comparison of run time left]
3. Round Robin, with different quantum values (RR) [preemptive by quantum]
1.2 Performance Metrics 
We are interested in computing the following metrics, for each experiment: 
• The average turnaround time 
• The total throughput (number of processes done per unit time) 
• The CPU utilization 
• The average number of processes (queue length) in the ready queue 
Note: There is a relationship between:
- average queue length n,
- average arrival time λ (in processes/second), and
Page 2 of 4
- average waiting time for a single process W (in seconds):
 n = λW.
This relationship allows computing any of these quantities from the other two.

2 The Simulator 
A discrete-time event simulation models the operation of a system as a discrete sequence of 
events in time. Each event occurs at a particular instant in time and marks a change of state
in the system. Between consecutive events, no change in the system is assumed to occur; 
thus the simulation time can directly jump to the occurrence time of the next event, which is 
called next-event time progression.
Your simulator needs to generate a list of CPU-bound processes (no I/O happens for them). 
For each process, we need to generate its arrival time and its requested service time (or
burst time). We can assume that processes arrive with an average rate λ that follows a 
Poisson process (hence exponential inter-arrival times). We will vary λ to simulate different 
loads. The service times are generated according to an exponential distribution (more detail 
below). 
The simulator should stop after handling 10,000 processes to completion (without stopping
the arrival of new processes), then it should output the statistics (i.e., the metrics above). 
Events (e.g., process arrival, process completion, time-slice occurrence) that occur cause the 
simulator to update its current state (e.g., CPU busy/idle, number of processes in the ready 
queue, etc.). To keep track and handle events in the right order, we keep events in a priority 
list (called the “Events List”) that describes the future events and is kept sorted by the time of 
each event. 
The simulator keeps a clock that represents the current system time, which takes the time 
from the event at the head of the Events List. Notice that when an event is handled at its 
assigned time, one or more future events may be added to the Events List. For example,
when a process gets serviced by the CPU, another process can start executing (if one is 
waiting in the “Process Ready Queue”) and under FCFS, we know exactly when this process 
would finish, so we can schedule a completion event in the future and place it in the Events 
List. Notice that time hops between events, so you will need to update your simulator clock 
accordingly. 
The simulator must take a few command-line arguments. The first one is to indicate the 
scheduling algorithm, a 1 through 3 value based on the list above. Also, it should take other 
arguments such as the average arrival rate, the average service time, and the quantum 
interval (for RR). Running the simulator with no arguments should display the arguments 
usage. 
Each scheduler will need to maintain a queue (the “Process Ready Queue”) for the ready 
processes that are waiting for the CPU. A scheduler will select a process to run next based on 
the scheduling policy. Clearly, this queue should not be confused with the simulation’s Events 
List that is used to hold events to be handled in the future. 

3 The Runs 
We will vary the average arrival rate, λ, of processes from 1 process per second to 30 
processes per second (based on a Poisson distribution). The service time is chosen 
according to an exponential distribution with an average service time of 0.06 sec. 
For each value of λ, we need to compare the performance of each scheduler, based on the 
metrics above. It is recommended that you write a simple batch file (script) that would run 
those experiments and put the results in a file (that you can later import into a spreadsheet to 
plot the values). 

Example script (assume your program is called sim and it creates the output file sim.data):
#!/bin/bash 
rm sim.data 
for ((i = 1; i <= 30; i++)); do 
 ./sim 1 $i 0.06 0.01
 cp sim.data /data/sim-1-$i-001.data
done

NOTICE:
The “sim” program called in the above script has the following four arguments:
• First: the scheduling algorithm number (1 to 3),
• Second: the number of processes per second as the arrival rate,
• Third: the average burst time for processes,
• Fourth: the quantum value (used for RR only).
This example bash script will run the simulator using FCFS (indicated by the value 1 in the
first argument) for 30 different values of λ, using 0.06 as the average service time and a 
quantum value of 0.01 (which is ignored in other algorithms, except in Round Robin). Then, 
the script will move the sim.data file to a safe place for later use. 
With the Round Robin algorithm, a fourth argument is supplied to indicate the quantum value 
to be used. Use 2 different values of quantum: 0.01 and 0.2 (i.e., make two different runs). 
Remember, if a process finishes before its quantum expires, the CPU should be scheduled for 
the next process right away. 

4 Submission details 
Submissions shall be done using the Assignments tool on the Canvas website for this class. 
Please submit a single zip file including all your files. 
Name your file program2_xxxxx.zip where xxxxx is your TX State NetID.
Submissions shall include:
the program’s source code, and
a report containing:
a brief overview of the design and implementation,
instructions for how to compile and run the simulator on one of the CS Linux 
servers, and 
the results of the experiments and their interpretation (more below). 
You need to run 4 different algorithm instances (since the Round Robin will have 2 different 
settings for quantum values), each one for 30 different values of λ. This means a total of 120 
runs (each run handling 10,000 processes to completion)! 
The report shall include a plot for each of the above four metrics (so, 4 plots total). The plot 
will vary λ (from 1 to 30) on the x-axis, and will represent the particular metric on the y-axis, 
with a different color line for each of the 4 algorithm instances (so, 4 lines per plot). 
You can write your simulator in any of these languages (C, C++, Python or Java), however, it 
is your responsibility to ensure it runs under the CS Linux servers with a command line –
nothing graphical (GUI-based) or IDE. Please indicate clearly how to compile and run your 
simulator. 
Attached to this assignment, is a skeleton of a C program you can use, see file “program2.c”.
You may form a 2 or 3-person team and work together on your programming assignments. If 
you submit a program that is the result of team work, you must cite the name of the other
collaborator(s) in the project file and indicate what part(s) of the project they worked on.
The penalty for not citing the collaborator will be -30% for that assignment. Each student 
must submit their own file (with their own NetID), even if it is the same file as the other 
student
